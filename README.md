Predicting the area of faulty nodes in IoMT.

This work inspired the patterns of distributing amyloid plaques in facing Depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases to predict the area of the detected faulty nodes of the IoMT-based applications. To follow the issue, we collected a dataset, including the activities of the astrocyte cells and proteins (GPR56, alpha, and beta), COVID-19 vaccination, Omicron variant's recorded symptoms, EEG, and ECG. To analyze the performance and dependability of IoMT, we simulated the defined applications before and after pruning the detected and predicted defective devices by the CupCarbon tool. Since the collected dataset consists of the estimated values of availability, security, and dependability, a short movie of injecting fault, and the logs of simulating the applications. 
To download the collected dataset, you have to receive all shared .rar files and extract them.
